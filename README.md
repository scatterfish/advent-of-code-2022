## Amy's Advent of Code 2022

My solutions for Advent of Code 2022.

My main language is [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/), and this is what I write solutions in first.

The objectives for my Crystal solutions are:
* Be simple.
* Be clean.
* Be concise.

### Other languages?

It's time for a grudge rematch with Rust this year. We'll see how long that ends up lasting.

I write solutions in other languages whenever I feel like doing it and have the time for it.
